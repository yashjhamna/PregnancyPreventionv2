        <h4> Teenage Pregnancy in Mauritius </h4>


        <img src="images/teen_pregnancy.jpg" width="50%" height="auto" id="img_about">


        <p> Most countries have an “age of consent” for sex of 16 or 18, under which it is illegal for
          young people to engage in sexual activities. It is however generally agreed that the number
          of teenage pregnancy in the modern society is increasing at an alarming rate.
          The Mauritian society is also experiencing this rise as this argument is buttressed
          by the 107 cases of teenage pregnancy recoded during the short time span of January 2016
          to July 2016. The majority of the victims are between 12 and 15 years old. </p>


        <p>In 2017, 208 cases of teenage pregnancies have been registered
        against 147 in 2015. Many factors account for this increase but the fundamental
        one is our flawed educational system. Education is a big word in itself,
        and is considered as the most prioritized factor to promote individual growth.
        It is thus indeed a cause of concern when that very same education fails to meet
        that goal. In Mauritius, our educational system is elitist, and adventures only in the
        academic fields, and amidst this, such a huge social problem as teenage pregnancy is being ignored. </p>


        <p> Over the past few years, the Ministry of Education has shown a readiness to introduce
        sex education in schools but this idea is always ruled out, being subject to controversies.
        According to Dr Ravhee Bholah, Sex Education is crucial in schools:
        “Students must have proper understanding of their own bodies. This is necessary for
        diverse reasons: an increase incidence of sexually transmitted infection (HIV/AIDS),
        an increase in teenage pregnancy, increased prevalence of other diseases (cervical cancer and breast cancer).
        It is also important for the youth to know how to deal with unintended pregnancy
        and be aware of the different types and use of contraceptives.’’</p>
